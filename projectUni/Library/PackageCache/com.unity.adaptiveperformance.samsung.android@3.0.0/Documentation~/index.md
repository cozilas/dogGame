# About the Adaptive Performance Samsung (Android) package

The Adaptive Performance Samsung (Android) provider is a subsystem for [Adaptive Performance](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.adaptiveperformance@latest/index.html) to extend Adaptive Performance to Samsung Android devices. It transmits device-specific information to the Adaptive Performance system and enables you to receive data about the thermal state of a Samsung Android device.

This package also provides access to a [Variable Refresh Rate](vrr.md) API that is supported by newer Samsung devices with high refresh rate displays.
